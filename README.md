# SharedShelves
SharedShelves is a mobile application designed to foster a love for reading among users by allowing them to exchange books, earn points, and discover new titles.
This app aims to help people efficiently manage their book collections, find new and interesting reads, and create a community of book lovers who share and discover literature together.


## Introduction
This project was carried out as part of the Human-Computer Interaction course and aims to develop a "revolutionary" app.
We primarily used **React Native**, a technology with which we had no prior experience, so the project structure might not be optimal. However, the evaluation focused mainly on the *heuristics, aesthetics, and ease of use* of the application for all types of users.

npm install   -- instalação das dependências necessárias
